This is a repository to track development that I do in Windows.  This started
because I'm teaching myself OpenGL and wanted to make sure my GL projects would
always build on both Windows and Linux for experience in the build and
deployment process on both.  Since Windows development is currently the minority
of the development I do, I'm going to put this all in a single repository.  If
that gets too much I'll split it out later.

This is mostly going to be done in Visual Studio, but I'm not too experienced
with what parts of a VS project are good to track in version control (if someone
wanted to educate me I would appreciate it), so I'm just going to track source
code for now.  If anyone is interested in what I'm doing and wants details on
how I set up the environment just ping me.

I will actually track some compiled library binaries for other's convenience.
For example the GLFW library (http://www.glfw.org/) didn't have binaries for
VS2015 so I built them.  Maybe having them here will save somebody some time.
