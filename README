This is a repository to track development that I do in Windows.  This started
because I'm teaching myself OpenGL and wanted to make sure my GL projects would
always build on both Windows and Linux for experience in the build and
deployment process on both.  Since Windows development is currently the minority
of the development I do, I'm going to put this all in a single repository.  If
that gets too much I'll split it out later.

I will actually track some compiled library binaries for other's convenience.
For example the GLFW library (http://www.glfw.org/) didn't have binaries for
VS2015 so I built them.  Maybe having them here will save somebody some time.
